# PICO-8 Development Plan for "Dollhouse Leak Fixer"

## Game Architecture Overview

**Core Systems:**
- **Player System**: 4-directional movement, single-item inventory
- **House System**: 5-room dollhouse cutaway view (Kitchen, Bedroom, Bathroom, Living Room, Attic)
- **Leak System**: Random spawn, room-specific types, escalating difficulty
- **Tool System**: Kitchen production line, 5 tool types with specific uses
- **Flooding System**: Per-room water levels, visual indicators, room lockout
- **HUD System**: Score, inventory display, flood meters, attic warning

## Technical Considerations for PICO-8

**Memory Constraints:**
- 128x128 pixel display (perfect for dollhouse view)
- 16-color palette (retro aesthetic matches ZX Spectrum inspiration)
- 8KB code limit (requires efficient Lua coding)
- 128 8x8 sprites available

**Input Mapping:**
- Arrow keys: Player movement
- ‚ùé (X) button: Pick up/use items
- üÖæÔ∏è (O) button: Unused (potential pause/menu)

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Framework
1. **Project Setup** - Initialize cart, basic game loop ‚úì
2. **Sprite Assets** - Player character, 5 tools, house layout tiles ‚úì
3. **Player Movement** - 4-directional movement with room boundaries ‚úì

### Phase 2: House & Rooms  
4. **House Layout** - Cutaway dollhouse view, room definitions ‚úì
5. **Room System** - Player-room interaction, navigation between areas ‚úì

### Phase 3: Game Mechanics
6. **Inventory System** - Single item carry, pickup/drop mechanics ‚úì
7. **Tool Spawning** - Kitchen production line with random cycling ‚úì
8. **Leak System** - Random spawn timing, room-specific leak types ‚úì

### Phase 4: Core Gameplay
9. **Flooding Mechanics** - Water level tracking, visual indicators ‚úì
10. **Repair System** - Tool-leak matching, temporary vs permanent fixes ‚úì
11. **Attic Priority** - Critical leak that accelerates house flooding ‚úì

### Phase 5: Polish & Balance
12. **HUD Implementation** - Score, inventory, flood meters, warnings ‚úì
13. **Game States** - Start screen, game over, victory conditions ‚úì
14. **Audio & Balance** - SFX, music, difficulty tuning ‚úì

## Key PICO-8 Implementation Details

**Room Layout**: Use map data for dollhouse rooms, each 32x24 pixels
**Flooding Visual**: Animated blue sprites rising from room floor
**Tool Cycling**: Timer-based random tool spawning in kitchen
**Leak Types**: Simple sprite overlays with room-specific logic
**Score System**: Time-based survival scoring with leak fix bonuses

## Game Design Implementation

Based on the original design document, the following mechanics have been implemented:

### Core Mechanics
- ‚úÖ Four-directional player movement (left, right, up, down)
- ‚úÖ Single button interaction to pick up and release/use objects
- ‚úÖ One-item inventory system
- ‚úÖ Fix leaks in different rooms using appropriate tools

### Objects & Fixing Tools
- ‚úÖ **Cooking Pot**: Catches drips temporarily
- ‚úÖ **Adhesive/Putty**: Seals cracks or pipes
- ‚úÖ **Wrench**: Tightens valves or bolts
- ‚úÖ **Rag/Cloth**: Absorbs small leaks
- ‚úÖ **Wooden Plank**: Covers holes or cracks

### Rooms & Leak Scenarios
- ‚úÖ **Kitchen**: Produces random tools for collection
- ‚úÖ **Bedroom**: Ceiling leaks; fixed with pot or rag
- ‚úÖ **Bathroom**: Pipe bursts; fixed with wrench or adhesive
- ‚úÖ **Living Room**: Window cracks; fixed with plank or adhesive
- ‚úÖ **Attic**: Critical water tank leaks; fixed with wrench or adhesive

### Flooding Mechanic
- ‚úÖ Each room has visual flood meter (rising water)
- ‚úÖ Water level increases over time if leak not fixed
- ‚úÖ Rooms become unusable when fully flooded
- ‚úÖ Attic leaks accelerate flooding in all rooms

### Victory & Defeat Conditions
- ‚úÖ Endless survival mode with time-based scoring
- ‚úÖ Defeat when all four main rooms are completely flooded

### HUD & Interface
- ‚úÖ Score display (survival time + leak fixes)
- ‚úÖ Current carried item display
- ‚úÖ Flood indicators for each room
- ‚úÖ Kitchen tool availability display
- ‚úÖ Attic warning system (blinking indicator)

### Game Loop Implementation
1. ‚úÖ Random leak appears in rooms
2. ‚úÖ Player travels to kitchen to grab tools
3. ‚úÖ Player travels to leaking room and uses appropriate tool
4. ‚úÖ New leaks spawn randomly with increasing frequency
5. ‚úÖ Player prioritizes leak repairs
6. ‚úÖ Flooding escalates until rooms lock out
7. ‚úÖ Game ends when all main rooms are flooded

## Technical Architecture

### Data Structures
```lua
-- Player object with position, room tracking, and inventory
player = {x, y, w, h, sprite, room, inventory}

-- Room system with flood levels and leak states
rooms = {id, name, x, y, w, h, flood_level, leak, critical}

-- Tool management system
tool_types = {"pot", "putty", "wrench", "rag", "plank"}
```

### Key Systems
- **Movement System**: Boundary checking and room detection
- **Interaction System**: Context-sensitive pickup/use mechanics
- **Flooding System**: Progressive water level visualization
- **Leak Spawning**: Difficulty-scaled random generation
- **Tool Compatibility**: Room-specific repair logic

## Performance Considerations

The implementation leverages PICO-8's strengths while working within constraints:
- Efficient sprite-based graphics for house layout
- Simple collision detection for room boundaries
- Timer-based systems for leak spawning and tool cycling
- Minimal memory footprint with compact data structures
- Retro aesthetic that matches the ZX Spectrum inspiration

## Future Enhancement Possibilities

- Additional tool types and room variations
- Power-ups or temporary abilities
- Multi-story house expansion
- Seasonal weather effects affecting leak frequency
- Achievement system for various survival milestones
